# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to my first data analytics project! This project is part of my IBM 10 week course for Data Analytics and serves as the final project certification. This project explores Airbnb data using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Tableau for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files, both in their original state and after undergoing the cleaning process.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualizations.
- `tableau/`: Tableau workbooks and visualizations.
- `images/`: Stores images used in analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Project Goals

- Utilize Python and Jupyter for data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
- Create advanced and interactive visualizations using Tableau.
- Explore trends and insights within Airbnb data.

## Tools Used

- Python and Jupyter Notebooks
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Seaborn and Matplotlib for initial visualizations
- Tableau for advanced data visualization and interactive dashboards

## Beginner's Note

This project marks my first dive into the world of data analytics! Through this project, I've been exploring the capabilities of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Tableau for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I'm excited to learn and grow while exploring Airbnb data and uncovering valuable insights. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always appreciated!
